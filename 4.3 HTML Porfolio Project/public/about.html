<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a current student at a public university studying Computer Science and with a minor in Data Science. Before aspiring to become a Software Engineer, 
  I experienced uncertainty regarding my career path. I often adhered to the belief that formal education was the sole source of reliable knowledge, 
  dismissing the value of online resources due to potential misinformation. 
  Additionally, I placed unwavering trust in the guidance of professors and teachers, 
  perceiving their teachings as the ultimate authority. However, I now recognize the limitations of this mindset. 
  While educators impart valuable insights based on their experiences, their teaching methods may not align with every 
  individual's learning style. 
  Hence, I contend that recognizing and adapting to one's unique learning preferences is paramount for effective learning and personal growth, 
  and last but not least I tend to think I am a life long learner.</p>
